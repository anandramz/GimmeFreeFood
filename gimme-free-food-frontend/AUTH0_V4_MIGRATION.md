# Auth0 v4 Migration - Completed Steps

## Problem Fixed ✅
The error `Module '"@auth0/nextjs-auth0"' has no exported member 'handleAuth'` occurred because you're using **@auth0/nextjs-auth0 v4.10.0**, which has breaking changes from v3.

## What Changed in v4
1. **Routes are now handled by middleware** - no need for `/app/auth/[...auth0]/route.ts`
2. **Environment variable names changed**
3. **Route paths changed** - `/api/auth/login` → `/auth/login`

## What I Fixed
✅ **Deleted** `/app/auth/[...auth0]/route.ts` - not needed in v4 (middleware handles routes automatically)

## Required Action: Update Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` currently has v3 variable names. Update them as follows:

### Change These Variables:
```bash
# OLD (v3)                    # NEW (v4)
AUTH0_BASE_URL          →     APP_BASE_URL
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL   →     AUTH0_DOMAIN (without https://)
```

### Your Updated `.env.local` Should Look Like:
```bash
# Required v4 variables
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com          # No https:// prefix!
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
AUTH0_SECRET=your_secret_key
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000             # Your app URL

# Optional - if you need custom routes
# NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGIN_ROUTE=/auth/login
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_ROUTE=/auth/profile
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN_ROUTE=/auth/access-token
```

### Important Notes:
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN` should be **without** the `https://` scheme (e.g., `example.us.auth0.com`, not `https://example.us.auth0.com`)
- `APP_BASE_URL` is your application's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for development)

## Update Auth0 Dashboard Settings

Since routes changed from `/api/auth/*` to `/auth/*`, update your Auth0 Application settings:

### Allowed Callback URLs:
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

### Allowed Logout URLs:
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/logout
```

## Your Current Setup (Already Correct) ✅
- ✅ `middleware.ts` is properly configured
- ✅ `lib/auth0.ts` has `Auth0Client` instance
- ✅ Route handler deleted (not needed in v4)

## Testing
After updating environment variables, test your auth flow:
1. Navigate to `/auth/login` to login
2. Navigate to `/auth/logout` to logout
3. Check `/auth/profile` for user info
